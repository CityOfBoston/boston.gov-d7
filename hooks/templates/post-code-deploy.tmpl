# Cloud Hook: post-code-deploy
#
# The post-code-deploy hook is run whenever you use the Workflow page to 
# deploy new code to an environment, either via drag-drop or by selecting
# an existing branch or tag from the Code drop-down list. See 
# ../README.md for details.
#
# Usage: post-code-deploy site target-env source-branch deployed-tag repo-url 
#                         repo-type
