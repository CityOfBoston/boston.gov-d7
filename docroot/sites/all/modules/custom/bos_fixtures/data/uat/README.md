# UAT Fixture Data

All UAT fixture data belongs in this folder. Media of any kind belongs
in the files directory. Fixture data belongs in xml files within the fixtures
directory.

This folder contains data meant to be observed by City of Boston officials when
performing UAT. It is meant to be more friendly to the eye than develompent
data, which tends to be more minimalist.
